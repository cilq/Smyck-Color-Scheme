# Smyck Color Scheme

This is a color scheme suitable for Sublime Text 3.

The colors are carefully chosen and the contrasts are tuned so that it
should not hurt the eyes even after a whole day of working.

# Disclaimer

Currently its still a moving target but if you want to help, please try
it out and report screenshots of weird looking things.

There is also an Eclipse adoption of this theme available at
[https://github.com/m42i/Smyck-Color-Scheme](https://github.com/m42i/Smyck-Color-Scheme).

Once the final color map is done this repository will include a proper
documentation.
